# EITP40_Project_Ali_Yingshuo
EITP40 Final Project

This project aims to build a number detective model trained by the Forward-Forward algorithm on the MNIST dataset.
The final outcome is expected to be deployed on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense with the peripheral camera.

The model will be trained by FF with TensorFlow, while the MicroTFLite will do the inference on the Arduino.
A bonus would be a 3-D printing frame to hold the cards (with handwritten numbers) and the camera.
